# AlfaBet App

This project was bootstrapped with `Create React App`.

## Running the project locally

First, run `npm install` all npm packages.

Then, run `npm run start`.

This Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### Note about relative imports

For some reason I couldn't get the imports working properly with `tsconfig.json` `paths` option.
So I just went for relative imports.
Please excuse me :)
